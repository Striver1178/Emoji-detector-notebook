# Emoji-detector-notebook

This project is a Python reimplementation of an emoji detection tool originally written in PHP. It demonstrates how to:

- âœ… Detect emojis in a string
- âœ… Check if a string contains a single emoji
- âœ… Replace emojis with placeholders
- âœ… Work with character offsets before emojis

The core logic is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook:  
**`emoji_detector_python_equivalent.ipynb`**

You can try this notebook locally or in a cloud environment like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Features

- Built with Python 3
- Uses the `regex` module for extended Unicode support
- No external dependencies beyond `regex`
